# Black Box Proxy Block 

As of this posting... Black Box Proxy Block has been discontinued.

The files located in the /archive folder are what is left from the service.

# Replacement 

I've been working on a replacement, and my current work can be seen working here. 

https://blackbox.ipinfo.app/lookup/8.8.8.8


# Goals 

I want to track down what the ASNs that are used in the script and maybe revamp and build my own rebuild of the Black Box Proxy Block service.

## Steps

Identify the IP addresses in the list, and why they are listed.

Build a system that will build and maintain the lists.

Create a front end API to query the lists.

Profit!?
